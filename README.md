Angles is a web experiment â€” a vinyl DJ set, decontructed.

The project is featuring a recording of a DJ set using two cameras and allowing the viewer to choose between four different viewing modes:

* Front camera
* Top camera
* Both cameras
* Automatic selection (ML-based)

The ML-based mode utilises Google's PoseNet library for TensorFlow.js to automatically detect the body pose that's interesting to look at from the top camera, and switches automatically to it.

Additionally, a simple additional layer (stylised after AR-like look and feel) is available showing the metadata of the music that's currently mounted in each turntable.
